# BrewDog's beer application

The application is deployed to Heroku. [Click to launch the application](https://brew-dog-react-app.herokuapp.com/)

After you clone or download the source code, run `yarn install`.

To launch the application locally, run `yarn run dev-server`.

For dev build, run `yarn run build:dev`.

For prod build, run `yarn run build:prod`

Improvements to be added:
1. Added a loader to improve the UX.
2. Extensive unit tests for searchBeer component.
3. Nice date picker to give flexibility to users.
4. Random non-alcoholic beer currently fetches the same random alcoholic beers because of the limitaion of the API.
5. Include search field input validation.
